My personal website features all of my current projects and functions as my primary portfolio. I tried building it without any frameworks to bolster my skills in pure JS. 

## TODOs (v1.1)
- [x] band-aid solution for landscape rotation
- [x] ios project showcase workaround (picture icon as modal button)
- [ ] fix px sizing (project containers, arrow)
- [ ] mobile language gate dropdown
- [ ] add "project on ice" in addition to "WIP" overlay

## Roadmap (v2.0)

- project categories
- search functionality
- showcase carousel refresh
